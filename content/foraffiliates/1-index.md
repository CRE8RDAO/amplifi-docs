Earning with AmpliFi is pretty simple.

# Getting accepted as an affiliate.

Not every AmpliFi campaign is available to all users.In some cases you may need to fill a form or send a message in discord to be accepted as an affiliate. In cases where there is more to do than simply verifing your twitter handle/address this will be made clear in the campaign overview. Often the next step will be to fill a form. But in some cases a proposal will need to be made to governance or a message will have to be sent in discord to the program manager.

Every campaign requires verification of twitter account/address.This ensures we know our affiliates and have an address to send payment to. Your twitter handle also doubles as your unique id.

# Understanding the program/campaign goals & payout structure

The campaign overview tab generally has two sections at the top. Incentives & KPIS.

## Incentives

Incentives are the payouts received when a certain action (KPI) happens becuase of your referral link

## KPIS

KPIs are the actions that are taken by your refererrs which result in incentives being paid out.


# Understanding the project you are promoting

AmpliFi aims to make the most important details about a project available within the campaign itself. And to provide links to things like docs, medium, github, whitepaper, etc.

As well as providing links to content that has already been produced by other affiliates, the project its self which can be referenced within your work where appropriate.

Every campaign will also have links to discord/telegram chat for the project so that you can reach out to team members and discuss. Some AmpliFi campaigns also have a dedicated discord channel for affiliates & project team to communicate.

# Planning your strategy

Now that you are up to speed with the project, & how incentives and KPIs work for the project its time to start thinking about your strategy to help the project reach the campaign goals! This is how you earn with AmpliFi.

If you write for a blog you might like to write an article about an upcoming event on the protocols roadmap. Adding your affiliate links along with a clear call to action which will help your link get more clicks.

If you have other place where you audience hangs out it might make sense to also share your content there as well. For example on twitter (consider repurposing the article as a thread - and make sure to share your affiliate link in the thead as well!).

Perhaps you have a discord to telegram channel associated with your blog. Or maybe a private group chat with friends. Whereever you decide to share your content complete with AmpliFi link(s). Make sure to include any special offer that comes along with using your link!

## Setting / comunicating special benifits that come with using your link

Many programs will offer special discounts or benifits for your referrers. This information will be made available in the campaign overview or in campaign tabs labeled special offers or similar.

## Setting % split of incentives with your audience on a per link basis.

On some campaigns AmpliFi allows affiliates/referers to share their payouts with referees.
When this campaign type is active you will be able to share a percentage (decided by you using the slider in UI) on both your $AMP rewards and your client token payouts.

Don't forget to communicate to your audience about the special benifits that come with using your link. To help articulate this check the twitter icon to generate a tweet that shares your referral link plus details about the split. Of course you can customise this text or copy it over into your preferred platform for sharing!
