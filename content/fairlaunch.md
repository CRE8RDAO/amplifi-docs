# Ownership & Governance of AmpliFi will become progressivly decentralised with each campaign.

At least 34% of total AmpliFi tokens will be distributed to Affiliates/Referrers (publishers, newsletter writers, group owners, social media accounts, etc).

## Targeted Conditional Airdrop: The most efficient way to distribute ownership proportionally based on concrete results

This has rarely (Looks Rare implemented several conditions in their Airdrop) been done before but once you get it we hope you will agree it's a useful mechanism & actually very intuitive.

AmpliFi team creates lists from various sources such as:

- Github
- Onchain
- Twitter
- Snapshot
- Publications & Newsletters list

We process relevent metrics for each list and assign a number of tokens member each list. These tokens are then earned alongside earnings for each AmpliFi campaign.
Over and above to proportional share of earnings - which is itself based on the unique campaign KPI.

In this way we are able to target the groups that we think will add the most value to AmpliFi & our client campaigns with a compelling conditional airdrop.
As long as they take part in campaigns they earn a multiple of their campaign earnings until their entire allocation is earned.
